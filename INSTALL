Installation:
	1) to build and install the commandline tools (nfs4_getfacl, 
	   nfs4_setfacl):
		   $ ./configure
		   $ make
		   $ make install


	2) to build and install the GUI editor (nfs4-acl-editor), first do the 
	   above steps.  then:
		   $ cd GUI/nfs4-acl-editor
		   $ qmake
		   $ make
		   $ cp nfs4-acl-editor <whatever-bin-path>
	
	   the `qmake` step should generate a Qt-friendly Makefile.  Note that
	   the GUI editor depends upon Qt 4.1.4 or later, and needs to link 
	   against the file nfs4-acl-tools/libnfs4acl/libnfs4acl.a.
	

	3) in case of trouble, please see "Random Notes" below or contact
	   nfsv4@linux-nfs.org.


Random Notes (about some distros..):
	the install targets "install-lib" and "install-dev", aren't actually
	wired-up.  we're not yet sure whether to prune this entirely or come
	back and do it for real.

	looks for /usr/include/attr/attr.h, but 'attr' dir doesn't exist for
	me.  after looking at the paths on my (old SuSE) system, i found that
	this worked:
	
	   sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux /usr/include/attr

	a different environment is building the 'attr' package wrong.  
	1) doesn't install xattr.h, 2) isn't installing libattr.la, libattr.a, 
	or libattr.so.1.1.0.  W/r/t the latter, i saw errors like:
	 
	     libtool: link: cannot find the library `/usr/lib/libattr.la' or 
	                    unhandled argument `/usr/lib/libattr.la'
	     gmake[1]: *** [nfs4_getfacl] Error 1
	     make: *** [default] Error 2

	if you have a libattr shared library and still see the above error, 
	rerunning `configure' and `make' should probably fix the problem.
	 

please send any email to <nfsv4@linux-nfs.org>.
